# Interactive PyTorch DDP Training in FastAI Jupyter Notebooks

`Ddip` ("Dee dip") --- Distributed Data "interactive" Parallel is a little iPython extension of line and cell magics to bring together `fastai` lesson notebooks [[1]](#course_v3) and PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel [[2]](#pytorchddp).  It uses `ipyparallel` [[3]](#ipp) to manage the DDP process group. 

Platform tested: single host with multiple Nvidia CUDA GPUs, Ubuntu linux + PyTorch + Python 3, fastai v1 and fastai course-v3.

## Features:

`Ddip` was conceived to address an unfilled gap mentioned in FastAI's [How to launch a distributed training](https://docs.fast.ai/distributed.html), that:
" *Distributed training doesnâ€™t work in a notebook ...*"


`Ddip` tries to make notebook experiments in FastAI to take advantage of multi-GPU/DDP a little easier:

1. Switch execution between PyTorch's multiprocess DDP group and local notebook namespace with ease.

2. Automatic `gc.collect()` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after parallel execution to avoid OOM.

3. Usually 3 - 5 lines of '%','%%' to port a Fastai `course v3` notebooks to run in DDP.

4. Extensible.  Porting to `fastai v2` is a high priority to-do.
5. Abstracted away the detail plumbing to harmonize `fastai`, `PyTorch DDP` and `ipyparallel` work with each other in the notebook environment.


## Installation:

`pip install git+https://github.com/philtrade/ipyparallel-torchddp.git`

## Overview and Examples:
### `Ddip` provides these iPython line and cell magics:
* `%load_ext Ddip`,  to load the extension
* `%makedip ...` to start/stop/restart a Distributed Data Parallel process group.  
* `%%dip ...` , to execute a cell in DDP, local notebook, or both.
* `%autodip ...`, to automatically execute subsequent cells in the DDP group, without requiring `%%dip` every time.
* `%dipush ...`, and `%dipull`, to pass things between the notebook and the DDP namespaces


### Examples:
* [The `fastai` lesson3-camvid notebook using `Ddip` to train in DDP](notebooks/Ddip_usage_fastai.ipynb),
* [More notebooks](notebooks/)
