# Interactive PyTorch DDP Training in FastAI Jupyter Notebooks

`Ddip` ("Dee dip") --- Distributed Data "interactive" Parallel is a little iPython extension of line and cell magics to bring together `fastai` lesson notebooks [[1]](#course_v3) and PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel [[2]](#pytorchddp).  It uses `ipyparallel` [[3]](#ipp) to manage the DDP process group. 

Platform tested: single host with multiple Nvidia CUDA GPUs, Ubuntu linux + PyTorch + Python 3, fastai v1 and fastai course-v3.

## Features:

    "Distributed training doesnâ€™t work in a notebook..."
>>>>-- *FastAI's tutorial on [How to launch a distributed training](https://docs.fast.ai/distributed.html)*

`Ddip` was conceived to address the above, with the following features:

1. Switch execution easily between PyTorch's multiprocess DDP group and local notebook namespace.

2. Takes 3 - 5 lines of iPython magics to port a Fastai `course v3` notebook to train in DDP.

3. Reduce chance of GPU out of memory error by automatically emptying GPU cache memory after executing a cell in the GPU proc.

4. Extensible architecture.  Future support for `fastai v2` could be implemented as a loadable module, like that for `fastai v1`.

## Installation:

Current version: 0.1.0

`pip install git+https://github.com/philtrade/Ddip.git@v0.1.0#egg=Ddip`

## Overview:
### `Ddip` provides these iPython line and cell magics:
* `%load_ext Ddip`,  to load the extension.
* `%makedip ...` to start/stop/restart a DDP group, and initialize a module such as `fastai_v1`.  
* `%%dip ...` , to execute a cell in the DDP group, or local notebook, or both.
* `%autodip ...`, to execute subsequent cells in the DDP group, without requiring `%%dip` every time.
* `%dipush`, and `%dipull`, to pass things between the notebook and the DDP namespaces.
